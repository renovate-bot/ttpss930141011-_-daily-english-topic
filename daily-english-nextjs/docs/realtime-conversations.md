Realtime conversations

Beta

==============================

Learn how to manage Realtime speech-to-speech conversations.

Once you have connected to the Realtime API through either [WebRTC](/docs/guides/realtime-webrtc) or [WebSocket](/docs/guides/realtime-websocket), you can call a Realtime model (such as [gpt-4o-realtime-preview](/docs/models/gpt-4o-realtime-preview)) to have speech-to-speech conversations. Doing so will require you to **send client events** to initiate actions, and **listen for server events** to respond to actions taken by the Realtime API.

This guide will walk through the event flows required to use model capabilities like audio and text generation and function calling, and how to think about the state of a Realtime Session.

If you do not need to have a conversation with the model, meaning you don't expect any response, you can use the Realtime API in [transcription mode](/docs/guides/realtime-transcription).

Realtime speech-to-speech sessions
----------------------------------

A Realtime Session is a stateful interaction between the model and a connected client. The key components of the session are:

*   The **Session** object, which controls the parameters of the interaction, like the model being used, the voice used to generate output, and other configuration.
*   A **Conversation**, which represents user input Items and model output Items generated during the current session.
*   **Responses**, which are model-generated audio or text Items that are added to the Conversation.

**Input audio buffer and WebSockets**

If you are using WebRTC, much of the media handling required to send and receive audio from the model is assisted by WebRTC APIs.

  

If you are using WebSockets for audio, you will need to manually interact with the **input audio buffer** by sending audio to the server, sent with JSON events with base64-encoded audio.

All these components together make up a Realtime Session. You will use client events to update the state of the session, and listen for server events to react to state changes within the session.

Session lifecycle events
------------------------

After initiating a session via either [WebRTC](/docs/guides/realtime-webrtc) or [WebSockets](/docs/guides/realtime-websockets), the server will send a [`session.created`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/session/created) event indicating the session is ready. On the client, you can update the current session configuration with the [`session.update`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/session/update) event. Most session properties can be updated at any time, except for the `voice` the model uses for audio output, after the model has responded with audio once during the session. The maximum duration of a Realtime session is **30 minutes**.

The following example shows updating the session with a `session.update` client event. See the [WebRTC](/docs/guides/realtime-webrtc#sending-and-receiving-events) or [WebSocket](/docs/guides/realtime-websocket#sending-and-receiving-events) guide for more on sending client events over these channels.

Update the system instructions used by the model in this session

```javascript
const event = {
  type: "session.update",
  session: {
    instructions: "Never use the word 'moist' in your responses!"
  },
};

// WebRTC data channel and WebSocket both have .send()
dataChannel.send(JSON.stringify(event));
```

```python
event = {
    "type": "session.update",
    "session": {
        "instructions": "Never use the word 'moist' in your responses!"
    }
}
ws.send(json.dumps(event))
```

When the session has been updated, the server will emit a [`session.updated`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/session/updated) event with the new state of the session.

|session.update|session.createdsession.updated|

Text inputs and outputs
-----------------------

To generate text with a Realtime model, you can add text inputs to the current conversation, ask the model to generate a response, and listen for server-sent events indicating the progress of the model's response. In order to generate text, the [session must be configured](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/session/update) with the `text` modality (this is true by default).

Create a new text conversation item using the [`conversation.item.create`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/conversation/item/create) client event. This is similar to sending a [user message (prompt) in Chat Completions](/docs/guides/text-generation) in the REST API.

Create a conversation item with user input

```javascript
const event = {
  type: "conversation.item.create",
  item: {
    type: "message",
    role: "user",
    content: [
      {
        type: "input_text",
        text: "What Prince album sold the most copies?",
      }
    ]
  },
};

// WebRTC data channel and WebSocket both have .send()
dataChannel.send(JSON.stringify(event));
```

```python
event = {
    "type": "conversation.item.create",
    "item": {
        "type": "message",
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "input_text",
                "text": "What Prince album sold the most copies?",
            }
        ]
    }
}
ws.send(json.dumps(event))
```

After adding the user message to the conversation, send the [`response.create`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/response/create) event to initiate a response from the model. If both audio and text are enabled for the current session, the model will respond with both audio and text content. If you'd like to generate text only, you can specify that when sending the `response.create` client event, as shown below.

Generate a text-only response

```javascript
const event = {
  type: "response.create",
  response: {
    modalities: [ "text" ]
  },
};

// WebRTC data channel and WebSocket both have .send()
dataChannel.send(JSON.stringify(event));
```

```python
event = {
    "type": "response.create",
    "response": {
        "modalities": [ "text" ]
    }
}
ws.send(json.dumps(event))
```

When the response is completely finished, the server will emit the [`response.done`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/response/done) event. This event will contain the full text generated by the model, as shown below.

Listen for response.done to see the final results

```javascript
function handleEvent(e) {
  const serverEvent = JSON.parse(e.data);
  if (serverEvent.type === "response.done") {
    console.log(serverEvent.response.output[0]);
  }
}

// Listen for server messages (WebRTC)
dataChannel.addEventListener("message", handleEvent);

// Listen for server messages (WebSocket)
// ws.on("message", handleEvent);
```

```python
def on_message(ws, message):
    server_event = json.loads(message)
    if server_event.type == "response.done":
        print(server_event.response.output[0])
```

While the model response is being generated, the server will emit a number of lifecycle events during the process. You can listen for these events, such as [`response.text.delta`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/response/text/delta), to provide realtime feedback to users as the response is generated. A full listing of the events emitted by there server are found below under **related server events**. They are provided in the rough order of when they are emitted, along with relevant client-side events for text generation.

Audio inputs and outputs
------------------------

One of the most powerful features of the Realtime API is voice-to-voice interaction with the model, without an intermediate text-to-speech or speech-to-text step. This enables lower latency for voice interfaces, and gives the model more data to work with around the tone and inflection of voice input.

### Voice options

Realtime sessions can be configured to use one of several built‑in voices when producing audio output. You can set the `voice` on session creation (or on a `response.create`) to control how the model sounds. Current voice options are `alloy`, `ash`, `ballad`, `coral`, `echo`, `sage`, `shimmer`, and `verse`. Once the model has emitted audio in a session, the `voice` cannot be modified for that session.

### Handling audio with WebRTC

If you are connecting to the Realtime API using WebRTC, the Realtime API is acting as a [peer connection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection) to your client. Audio output from the model is delivered to your client as a [remote media stream](hhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream). Audio input to the model is collected using audio devices ([`getUserMedia`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia)), and media streams are added as tracks to to the peer connection.

The example code from the [WebRTC connection guide](/docs/guides/realtime-webrtc) shows a basic example of configuring both local and remote audio using browser APIs:

```javascript
// Create a peer connection
const pc = new RTCPeerConnection();

// Set up to play remote audio from the model
const audioEl = document.createElement("audio");
audioEl.autoplay = true;
pc.ontrack = e => audioEl.srcObject = e.streams[0];

// Add local audio track for microphone input in the browser
const ms = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
  audio: true
});
pc.addTrack(ms.getTracks()[0]);
```

The snippet above enables simple interaction with the Realtime API, but there's much more that can be done. For more examples of different kinds of user interfaces, check out the [WebRTC samples](https://github.com/webrtc/samples) repository. Live demos of these samples can also be [found here](https://webrtc.github.io/samples/).

Using [media captures and streams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Capture_and_Streams_API) in the browser enables you to do things like mute and unmute microphones, select which device to collect input from, and more.

### Client and server events for audio in WebRTC

By default, WebRTC clients don't need to send any client events to the Realtime API before sending audio inputs. Once a local audio track is added to the peer connection, your users can just start talking!

However, WebRTC clients still receive a number of server-sent lifecycle events as audio is moving back and forth between client and server over the peer connection. Examples include:

*   When input is sent over the local media track, you will receive [`input_audio_buffer.speech_started`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/input_audio_buffer/speech_started) events from the server.
*   When local audio input stops, you'll receive the [`input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/input_audio_buffer/speech_started) event.
*   You'll receive [delta events for the in-progress audio transcript](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/response/audio_transcript/delta).
*   You'll receive a [`response.done`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/response/done) event when the model has transcribed and completed sending a response.

Manipulating WebRTC APIs for media streams may give you all the control you need. However, it may occasionally be necessary to use lower-level interfaces for audio input and output. Refer to the WebSockets section below for more information and a listing of events required for granular audio input handling.

### Handling audio with WebSockets

When sending and receiving audio over a WebSocket, you will have a bit more work to do in order to send media from the client, and receive media from the server. Below, you'll find a table describing the flow of events during a WebSocket session that are necessary to send and receive audio over the WebSocket.

The events below are given in lifecycle order, though some events (like the `delta` events) may happen concurrently.

### Streaming audio input to the server

To stream audio input to the server, you can use the [`input_audio_buffer.append`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/input_audio_buffer/append) client event. This event requires you to send chunks of **Base64-encoded audio bytes** to the Realtime API over the socket. Each chunk cannot exceed 15 MB in size.

The format of the input chunks can be configured either for the entire session, or per response.

*   Session: `session.input_audio_format` in [`session.update`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/session/update)
*   Response: `response.input_audio_format` in [`response.create`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/response/create)

Append audio input bytes to the conversation

```javascript
import fs from 'fs';
import decodeAudio from 'audio-decode';

// Converts Float32Array of audio data to PCM16 ArrayBuffer
function floatTo16BitPCM(float32Array) {
  const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(float32Array.length * 2);
  const view = new DataView(buffer);
  let offset = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < float32Array.length; i++, offset += 2) {
    let s = Math.max(-1, Math.min(1, float32Array[i]));
    view.setInt16(offset, s < 0 ? s * 0x8000 : s * 0x7fff, true);
  }
  return buffer;
}

// Converts a Float32Array to base64-encoded PCM16 data
base64EncodeAudio(float32Array) {
  const arrayBuffer = floatTo16BitPCM(float32Array);
  let binary = '';
  let bytes = new Uint8Array(arrayBuffer);
  const chunkSize = 0x8000; // 32KB chunk size
  for (let i = 0; i < bytes.length; i += chunkSize) {
    let chunk = bytes.subarray(i, i + chunkSize);
    binary += String.fromCharCode.apply(null, chunk);
  }
  return btoa(binary);
}

// Fills the audio buffer with the contents of three files,
// then asks the model to generate a response.
const files = [
  './path/to/sample1.wav',
  './path/to/sample2.wav',
  './path/to/sample3.wav'
];

for (const filename of files) {
  const audioFile = fs.readFileSync(filename);
  const audioBuffer = await decodeAudio(audioFile);
  const channelData = audioBuffer.getChannelData(0);
  const base64Chunk = base64EncodeAudio(channelData);
  ws.send(JSON.stringify({
    type: 'input_audio_buffer.append',
    audio: base64Chunk
  }));
});

ws.send(JSON.stringify({type: 'input_audio_buffer.commit'}));
ws.send(JSON.stringify({type: 'response.create'}));
```

```python
import base64
import json
import struct
import soundfile as sf
from websocket import create_connection

# ... create websocket-client named ws ...

def float_to_16bit_pcm(float32_array):
    clipped = [max(-1.0, min(1.0, x)) for x in float32_array]
    pcm16 = b''.join(struct.pack('<h', int(x * 32767)) for x in clipped)
    return pcm16

def base64_encode_audio(float32_array):
    pcm_bytes = float_to_16bit_pcm(float32_array)
    encoded = base64.b64encode(pcm_bytes).decode('ascii')
    return encoded

files = [
    './path/to/sample1.wav',
    './path/to/sample2.wav',
    './path/to/sample3.wav'
]

for filename in files:
    data, samplerate = sf.read(filename, dtype='float32')  
    channel_data = data[:, 0] if data.ndim > 1 else data
    base64_chunk = base64_encode_audio(channel_data)
    
    # Send the client event
    event = {
        "type": "input_audio_buffer.append",
        "audio": base64_chunk
    }
    ws.send(json.dumps(event))
```

### Send full audio messages

It is also possible to create conversation messages that are full audio recordings. Use the [`conversation.item.create`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/conversation/item/create) client event to create messages with `input_audio` content.

Create full audio input conversation items

```javascript
const fullAudio = "<a base64-encoded string of audio bytes>";

const event = {
  type: "conversation.item.create",
  item: {
    type: "message",
    role: "user",
    content: [
      {
        type: "input_audio",
        audio: fullAudio,
      },
    ],
  },
};

// WebRTC data channel and WebSocket both have .send()
dataChannel.send(JSON.stringify(event));
```

```python
fullAudio = "<a base64-encoded string of audio bytes>"

event = {
    "type": "conversation.item.create",
    "item": {
        "type": "message",
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "input_audio",
                "audio": fullAudio,
            }
        ],
    },
}

ws.send(json.dumps(event))
```

### Working with audio output from a WebSocket

**To play output audio back on a client device like a web browser, we recommend using WebRTC rather than WebSockets**. WebRTC will be more robust sending media to client devices over uncertain network conditions.

??? from here until ???END lines may have been inserted/deleted
But to work with audio output in server-to-server applications using a WebSocket, you will need to listen for [`response.audio.delta`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/response/audio/delta) events containing the Base64-encoded chunks of audio data from the model. You will either need to buffer these chunks and write them out to a file, or maybe immediately stream them to another source like [a phone call with Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/blog/twilio-openai-realtime-api-launch-integration).

Note that the [`response.audio.done`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/response/audio/done) and [`response.done`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/response/done) events won't actually contain audio data in them - just audio content transcriptions. To get the actual bytes, you'll need to listen for the [`response.audio.delta`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/response/audio/delta) events.

The format of the output chunks can be configured either for the entire session, or per response.

*   Session: `session.output_audio_format` in [`session.update`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/session/update)
*   Response: `response.output_audio_format` in [`response.create`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/response/create)

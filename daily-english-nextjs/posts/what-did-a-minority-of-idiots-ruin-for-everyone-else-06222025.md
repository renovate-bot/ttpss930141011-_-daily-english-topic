## 3. Grammar & Sentence Patterns Analysis:

---
### 3.1 Pattern 1: Contrasting with "on one hand... but on the other..."
Structure: on one hand + clause, (but) on the other hand + clause

From Reddit: “on one hand people can't wipe their ass, but on the other they can drive 80 mph in organized lanes”

More examples:
- “On one hand I love summer, but on the other hand it’s too hot to go outside.”
- “On one hand she’s very talented, but on the other hand she lacks experience.”
- “On one hand we save money cooking at home, but on the other hand eating out is more fun.”

Common mistakes to avoid:
- ❌ “On one hand I like coffee, on the other tea.”
- ✅ “On one hand I like coffee, but on the other hand I prefer tea.”

---
### 3.2 Pattern 2: Story opener “Once upon a time”
Structure: Once upon a time, subject + past verb ...

From Reddit: “Once upon a time (in the 1970s), plane hijackings were super common.”

More examples:
- “Once upon a time, people could board planes without metal detectors.”
- “Once upon a time, libraries were the only place to get books.”
- “Once upon a time, payphones were everywhere on the street.”

Common mistakes:

• “tactical dehydration” → TAC-ti-cal de-hy-DRA-tion → /ˌtæk.tɪ.kəl ˌdiː.haɪˈdreɪ.ʃən/
  - Tip: give extra stress to “dra” in dehydration.

• “cluster of bees” → CLUS-ter of BEES → /ˈklʌs.tər əv biːz/
  - Tip: link “of” quickly to “bees.”

---
### 4.2 Intonation for Emotion:

### 5.1 Cultural Understanding:
Public rules often tighten after rare but dramatic incidents. Discussing these examples helps learners see why small actions can lead to big regulations. It also highlights social norms about cleanliness and safety.

In this AITA thread, the Original Poster (OP) refused to give up their only bus seat to a passenger holding a crying baby. Passengers and OP debate courtesy, “first come, first served,” and parent etiquette.

## 2. Learning Points:

---

### 2.1 Common Colloquial Phrases & Idioms

## 4. Open-Ended Discussion Questions
1. In your country, is it expected to give up your seat for parents with babies or for elderly people? Why or why not?
2. Have you ever been in a situation on public transport that tested your manners? How did you handle it?

---
## 5. Template Answers (Conversational English)
Answer 1:
“I get why the mom was stressed, but the OP paid for that seat first. In my view, public transport runs on a ‘first come, first served’ policy. If the baby was really upset, she could’ve asked politely or looked for an empty spot herself.”

Answer 2:
“TBH, I think it’s common courtesy to give up a seat, especially if you see someone struggling. Even if you’re entitled to sit, a simple ‘Would you like to sit here?’ goes a long way. It’s about kindness, not just following rules.”

---
## 6. Cultural Background or Context Explanation
In many Western countries, courtesy seats on buses or trains are informally reserved for the elderly, pregnant people, or those with young children. While there is no strict law, social norms encourage giving up seats. On Reddit, AITA threads often showcase these cultural expectations clashing with personal boundaries.

Answer to Q1:
“I think I could start reading five pages of a book every morning. I’ve always wanted to read more, and IMO, even five pages will add up. FWIW, I already use a habit tracker app, so I’ll set a daily reminder.”

Answer to Q2:
“Definitely! Last year I decided to write one sentence in my journal every night. At first it felt pointless, but by month three, I was writing full pages without thinking. That snowball effect surprised me!”

## 6. Cultural Background or Context Explanation:
In many English-speaking cultures—particularly in the US—there’s a strong “self-improvement” mindset. People enjoy sharing “life hacks” and small daily rituals on social media and Reddit. This context explains why phrases like “pay dividends” or “snowball effect” are so common in online discussions.

### Template A: Self-Discovery Methods

“I realized I felt most alive when I was [organizing workshops/translating complex ideas into visuals/helping people learn new skills]. To dig deeper, I started journaling after every workday and noticed a pattern: tasks where I got to **connect dots** across topics left me energized. I also took a **StrengthsFinder** assessment, which confirmed my top strengths—**Strategic thinking** and **Learner**. That combination made me confident to pivot into **learning experience design**, where I now wake up excited every morning.”

---

---

### Template B: Testing Career Fit

“When I’m eyeing a new role, I follow a three-step approach:

1. **List Energizers vs. Drainers** – I make two columns of activities that either pump me up or wear me out.
2. **Run Mini-Experiments** – For instance, I volunteered to lead a one-hour workshop or took on a short freelance gig in that field.
3. **Reflect & Adjust** – After each trial, I rate how I felt on a scale of 1–5 and jot down specific moments I enjoyed or disliked.
This process helped me rule out roles that sounded cool but drained me, and double-down on the ones where I felt genuinely motivated.”1e:Ta0b,## Link:

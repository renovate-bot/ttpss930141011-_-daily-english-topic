## 5. Template Answers (Conversational English):
Answer 1:
"I once paid for a weekend trip on my credit card, but I couldn’t afford it. I ended up stressed about high interest and cut back on groceries to pay the bill."

Answer 2:
"I love fancy coffee, so I could pay $5 every morning. But I realized I couldn't afford that habit long-term—so I switched to brewing at home."

## 6. Cultural Background or Context Explanation:
In the US and many Western countries, credit cards, loans, and subscription services are common. People often conflate "payable" with "affordable." Luxury brands like Bentley and Ferrari symbolize wealth, but the true cost includes maintenance, insurance, and emotional stress. Food delivery apps (DoorDash, Uber Eats) offer convenience, yet fees can be three times the meal price. Understanding these norms helps learners navigate both language and lifestyle.

## 7. Extension Activity:
Role-play a conversation: Student A wants to buy an expensive gadget. Student B advises using the "can pay vs. can afford" framework. Use at least three idioms from this lesson (e.g., "drain your bank account," "shockingly expensive"). Switch roles and discuss your fictional budgets.

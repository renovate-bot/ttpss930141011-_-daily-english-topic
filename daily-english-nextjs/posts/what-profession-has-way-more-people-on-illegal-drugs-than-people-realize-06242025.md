**More examples**:

- "He used to drink coffee every morning." (routine)
- "We used to meet often." (regular action)

**Common mistakes to avoid**:

## 4. Pronunciation & Speaking Practice:
Focus on stress patterns and intonation to sound natural.

---
### 4.1 Stress Patterns & Rhythm:

  - Tip: emphasize both adjectives equally.

---
## 5. Cultural Context & Background:
Understanding social norms and perspectives.

---
### 5.1 Cultural Understanding:
Call center roles often carry high stress and low pay, leading some to substance use as a coping mechanism. Discussing this topic helps learners navigate real workplace conversations.

---
### 5.2 Regional Differences:
- American English: "center", "drunk"; direct discussion of habits.
- British English: "centre", may say "smashed" for very drunk.
- Australian/Canadian English: similar to US but with local slang variances.

---
## 6. Discussion Questions & Pyramid Answers:
Encourage critical thinking and structured speaking.

---
### 6.1 Discussion Questions:
1. Why might high-pressure jobs lead to increased substance use?
2. Have you ever used humor or slang to cope with stress at work?
3. How do attitudes toward workplace stress differ in your culture?

---
### 6.2 Model Answer Using Pyramid Structure:
**Question**: Why might high-pressure jobs lead to increased substance use?

**üî∏ Main Point (Top of Pyramid)**:
"Stressful jobs can push people to use substances as a coping mechanism."

**üîπ Supporting Details (Middle)**:
"High call volumes, no breaks, and emotional strain cause exhaustion. For instance, handling 50 calls an hour without downtime. Additionally, peer behavior normalizes drinking or drug use."

**üîπ Personal Connection & Elaboration (Base)**:
"I once interned in a busy office where I felt burnt out daily and considered caffeine pills to stay alert. This reminds me of the Reddit thread during lockdowns. In my experience, lacking support worsens stress."

**üî∏ Conclusion & Connection**:
"Ultimately, without healthy coping strategies and support, stressful work environments can lead people toward substance use as a quick fix."

---
### 6.3 Alternative Response Style:
**Storytelling Approach**:
"Last month, I covered a 12-hour shift at a busy help desk. Calls kept coming non-stop, and I felt drained by midday. It reminded me of the Reddit comment about no after-call breaks. The key thing I learned was to set mini-break goals and breathe deeply between calls. I think many can relate to needing quick coping tactics in high-stress roles."
